        <h3>Algorithm:Geometry Convex hull/Sweepline/Misc</h3>
        <blockquote>In geometry, the convex hull or convex envelope or convex 
          closure of a shape is the smallest convex set that contains it.
          The convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all
          convex sets containing a given subset of a Euclidean space, or 
          equivalently as the set of all convex combinations of points in 
          the subset. For a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull 
          may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched
          around the subset.</blockquote>
